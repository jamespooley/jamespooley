Howdy, there! I'm a data scientist at [360i](https://www.360i.com/), an integrated creative and media agency in NYC.
I currently work on data projects and products with a strong econometric and operations research flavor.

* I like building statistical models for person-level data (but am also concerned about the implications of such data) 👨 🔒
* I like time series forecasting 📈 🔮
* I like stochastic (especially Poisson) processes 🎲 🐟
* I like programming in 🐍 and in 🏴‍☠️  and setting my programs loose in the ☁️
* I like writing clear, comprehensive, usable documentation 📝 💡
