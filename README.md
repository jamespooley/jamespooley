Howdy, there! I'm a data scientist and manager of data scientists at [360i](https://www.360i.com/), an integrated creative and media agency in NYC.

* As an IC, I currently work on data projects and products with a strong econometrics and operations research flavor.
    * I like modeling person-level data ðŸ‘¨
    * I like time series forecasting ðŸ“ˆ
    * I like stochastic processes ðŸŽ²
* As a people manager, I optimize for team psychological safety.
