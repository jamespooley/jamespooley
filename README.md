Howdy, there! I'm a data scientist at [PebblePost](https://www.pebblepost.com/).

<!-- * I like building statistical models for person-level data (but am also concerned about the privacy implications of such data) 👨 🔒 -->
<!-- * I like time series forecasting 📈 🔮 -->
<!-- * I like stochastic (especially Poisson) processes 🎲 🐟 -->
<!-- * I like programming in Python and R and setting my programs loose in the cloud. 🐍 🏴‍☠️  ☁️ -->
<!-- * I like writing clear, comprehensive, usable documentation 📝 💡 -->

When not working with data, I'm usually [consuming](https://wordhorde.com/) [dark](https://www.valancourtbooks.com/horror--science-fiction.html)
[fiction](https://undertowpublications.com/), swimming in [oceans of sound](https://serpentstail.com/work/ocean-of-sound/),
and can sometimes be [spotted dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWstd3jDZIs) in Brooklyn ... poorly.
