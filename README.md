Howdy, there! I'm a data scientist and manager of data scientists at [360i](https://www.360i.com/), an integrated creative and media agency in NYC.

* As an IC, I currently work on data projects and products with a strong econometrics and operations research flavor.
    * I like building statistical models for person-level data (but am also concerned about the implications of such data) 👨 🔒
    * I like time series forecasting 📈 🔮
    * I like stochastic (especially Poisson) processes 🎲 🐟
    * I like programming in 🐍 and in 🏴‍☠️
    * I like writing clear, comprehensive, usable documentation 📝 💡
* As a people manager, I prioritize team psychological safety and work to engineer a pit of success for my direct reports 🕳️ 😊.
